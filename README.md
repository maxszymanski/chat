# Academigo

Academigo is a web app built as a centralized hub for online courses from across the internet. Think of it like IMDb, but for learning, it doesn't host the content itself, but helps users find, compare, and choose the best courses out there. Each course links directly to the original provider's site.

🧠 The idea is simple: instead of browsing dozens of platforms, users can explore, rate, and bookmark courses in one place. Everyone can contribute, even if they don't own the course, by adding new ones to the database.

## General Information

This project was created to solve a real problem: the overwhelming amount of scattered online learning resources. With Academigo, the goal was to make it easier to discover and organize high-quality courses, all in one platform.

The design is mine from start to finish, and the whole app was developed with real user experience in mind. One of the biggest challenges was building a user-friendly student panel, ranking system, and rich text editing for course descriptions.


## What the app offers:

-   🔎 Course search & filtering – by category, subcategory, specialization, and course type
-   ⭐ Course rating & comparison – users can review, like, on courses

-   👤 Student dashboard – manage your saved, rated, added, or liked courses

-   🚩 Report system – flag outdated or rule-breaking courses/users
